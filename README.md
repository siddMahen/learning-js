# learning js

Let's learn some javascript!

To download these lessons, type the following commands in the terminal
window:

```
$ curl -L http://git.io/_ScX3Q | tar -xz
$ mv learning-js-master
```

## Getting Started

Before we can begin these tutorials, you're going to have to install
[node.js](http://wwww.nodejs.org/). Node.js is a command line program which
allows us to execute javascript without a browser.

## Our Programming Environment

Since node is a command line program, the majority of our programming will
occur on the command line. On Macs, the command line can be accessed through
the Terminal application.

The command line is a text interface to your computer which allows you to
write and edit software, navigate the file system and execute programs, among
many other things.

Here are a few basic commands to get you started:

* `ls` - `ls` stands for list. `ls` will list the files and sub-directories
in you current directory. For example, in a directory called Cookie Recipes,
`ls` may yield the following list: ChocolateChip.txt Oatmeal.txt

* `cd [some directory]` - `cd` stands for change directory. The parameter you
pass to `cd` is the directory you will be taken to. For example:
`cd ~/Desktop/` will take you to your Desktop directory.

* `clear` - `clear` clears the console screen, giving you a blank slate to
work with.

## Our Editor

This course will use Vim as it's command line text editor.

Vim is an extremely powerful, yet minimal text editor. I guarantee
that not only will Vim become your preferred way to edit code, but it will
also become your preferred way to edit text in general.

To quickly setup Vim before we begin, please run the following command in this
projects root directory:

    $ ./setup.sh

For a gentle introduction to Vim, please run the `vimtutor` command on the
command line.
